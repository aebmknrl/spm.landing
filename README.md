# Sanbric Designs Landing Page

Sanbric Designs Landing Page (SDLP) is part of the new image of the Company "Sanbric Designs, C.A." which is from Caracas, Venezuela.
This webpage was created for the development team and uses Webpack + HTML + SCSS + jQuery for landing pages purposes only. This project is part of SPM main project, which involves others projects and technologies.

# Branches

SDLP haves currently 2 branches:

 - master
 - webpack

 The **master** branch was the original project with the sames technologies used in the webpack branch but was created using scaffolding with [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) and the deprecated bower. The current active branch is **webpack**. This branch uses [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/) with some plugins and loaders.

## Running the project

To run the project use the webpack branch.
Clone the project and run:

    yarn
 to add some dependencies.
 In order to use the local *webpack-dev-server* run:
 

    yarn build
to build the final bundle run:

    yarn build:prod
This will output the folder dist with all the necessary files to run the project.
